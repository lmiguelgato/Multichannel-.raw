# Multichannel-.raw
Conversion from multiple .wav files to a single multi-channel .raw file. Useful interface with ODAS.

This project makes use of the [wav2raw](https://github.com/Zguy/wav2raw) project authored by Johannes HÃ¤ggqvist.

Warning: The .m script works well on Octave 4.2.2 for Linux. Compatibility issues may appear with older Octave versions or with MATLAB.
